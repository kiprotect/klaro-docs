Klaro is a privacy and security tool that helps you to manage user consent and protects sensitive and personal data in the frontend.

To get up and running we recommend to first read the section on how to [get started]({{'getting-started'|href}}) with Klaro, which will guide you through the process of setting up Klaro. Then, you can have a look at the [annotated example config]({{'integration.annotated-config'|href}}) to learn how to configure Klaro. Finally, you can read the [Javascript]({{'api.js-api'|href}}) to learn how you can interact with Klaro programatically.

We also keep a detailed log of all our [releases]({{'releases'|href}}) that you can consult to see what has changed in any release and learn about any breaking changes, new features, bugfixes and security-related updates.
